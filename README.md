Business Cards App

Hey there! Welcome to the Business Cards App. It’s a simple React app built with Vite that lets you manage business cards.

Here’s what you can do:

Sign up to create an account and get started.
Log in to your account whenever you want.
If you're a business user, you can create new business cards.
Anyone can view all the cards.
You can edit or delete only your own cards.
Logged-in users can like cards they enjoy.
You can also update your profile to personalize the app a bit.
Tech stuff:

React is used for building the interface.
Vite makes development faster.
MUI (Material-UI) gives us the UI components.
JOI handles form validation.
React Router DOM takes care of the app’s navigation.
Axios is used for making HTTP requests.
How to run it:

Clone the repo, then run npm install.
Start the server with npm run dev.
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5173 (or whatever port it shows).
That’s it! Hope you enjoy using the app.

Best,
Ori
